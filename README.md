# Banner Grabbing

A Python script to perform banner grabbing on a target IP and port.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.

```bash
pip install socket
pip install pyfiglet
pip install termcolor

```

## Usage

The script prompts the user to enter the target IP and port. The banner function creates a socket connection to the target, receives up to 1024 bytes of data, and prints the data as a string with leading and trailing white spaces stripped.

```python
python3 BannerGrabbing.py


```
